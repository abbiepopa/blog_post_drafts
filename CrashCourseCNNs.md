# Deep Learning, ANNs, CNNs... what's all the rage? 

If you have a twitter feed like mine (i.e., nerdy) you can hardly go a day without seeing some mention of "deep learning." In fact a quick glance at google anayltics 
shows that searches for deep learning have been rising over the past 5 years or so. I included "linear regression" to have a point of comparison. (You'll note the famous 
"people search for this more when school is in session" trend associated with linear regression.)

So what's all the fuss about? Here, I will offer a crash course that will be enough to let you play around with deep neural networks. Note, this is not a (apologies) deep
 explanation. For that I highly recommend [Stanford's CS231 class](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), available online.
